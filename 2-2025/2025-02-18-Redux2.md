### 7. Using the Switch Statement to Handle Multiple Actions  
#### 7.1. Handling Multiple Actions in a Reducer with Switch Statement  
- When the application has multiple states that need to be updated, we use a switch-case statement in the reducer to handle them.  
- Example: Managing the login state (authenticated) with two main actions:  
  - "LOGIN": Set authenticated = true.  
  - "LOGOUT": Set authenticated = false.  

#### 7.2. Structure of a Reducer with Switch Statement  
```javascript
function authReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "LOGIN":
      return { authenticated: true };  // User logs in
    case "LOGOUT":
      return { authenticated: false }; // User logs out
    default:
      return state; // Keep the current state if action does not match
  }
}
```
- `switch (action.type)` checks the action type.  
- `case "LOGIN"` → Update authenticated = true.  
- `case "LOGOUT"` → Update authenticated = false.  
- Always include a `default` to return the current state if no matching action is found.  

#### 7.3. Exercise  
- Write a reducer to handle "LOGIN" and "LOGOUT" actions.  
- Use switch-case to check the action.  
- Return a new state that fits the action.  
- Add a default to return the current state if no action matches.  

```javascript
const defaultState = {
  authenticated: false
};

// Reducer handles LOGIN and LOGOUT actions
const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "LOGIN":
      return { authenticated: true };  // When login, authenticated = true
    case "LOGOUT":
      return { authenticated: false }; // When logout, authenticated = false
    default:
      return state; // Keep the current state if the action does not match
  }
};

// Create store with reducer
const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

// Action Creators
const loginUser = () => ({ type: "LOGIN" });
const logoutUser = () => ({ type: "LOGOUT" });

// Test dispatch
store.dispatch(loginUser());  // authenticated -> true
console.log(store.getState()); // { authenticated: true }

store.dispatch(logoutUser()); // authenticated -> false
console.log(store.getState()); // { authenticated: false }
```

#### 7.4. Notes  
- Avoid directly changing the state, always return a new object `{ authenticated: true/false }`.  
- The default case is very important to ensure the state is not lost if the action does not match.  
- This pattern can be extended by adding more cases for future actions.

### 8. Use `const` for Action Types  
#### 8.1. Benefits of Using `const` for Action Types  
- Prevents typos: Writing the strings `'LOGIN'` or `'LOGOUT'` directly can lead to spelling mistakes.  
- Easier to modify and reuse: If you need to change the action name, you only need to change it once.  
- Makes code more readable: Defining action types in one place helps organize the code better.  

#### 8.2. How to Use `const` for Action Types  
- Step 1: Define constants for action types:  
```javascript
const LOGIN = "LOGIN";
const LOGOUT = "LOGOUT";
```
- Step 2: Use these constants in the reducer:  
```javascript
function authReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case LOGIN:
      return { authenticated: true };
    case LOGOUT:
      return { authenticated: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```
- Step 3: Use the constants in action creators:  
```javascript
function loginAction() {
  return { type: LOGIN };
}

function logoutAction() {
  return { type: LOGOUT };
}
```

#### 8.3. Exercise  
- Define `const LOGIN = "LOGIN";` and `const LOGOUT = "LOGOUT";`.  
- Modify the reducer to use `LOGIN` and `LOGOUT` instead of the string directly.  
- Modify action creators (`loginAction` and `logoutAction`) to use the constants.

```javascript
// Define action types using const
const LOGIN = "LOGIN";
const LOGOUT = "LOGOUT";

// Default state of the Redux store
const defaultState = {
  authenticated: false
};

// Reducer handles LOGIN and LOGOUT actions
const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case LOGIN:
      return { authenticated: true };
    case LOGOUT:
      return { authenticated: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Create Redux store
const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

// Action Creators using constants
const loginUser = () => ({ type: LOGIN });
const logoutUser = () => ({ type: LOGOUT });
```

### 9. Register a Store Listener  
#### 9.1. Introduction to `store.subscribe()` in Redux  
- `store.subscribe(listener)` registers a listener function that runs whenever the Redux store receives an action.  
- The listener does not change the state; it simply reacts to changes in the store.  
- This can be used for logging the state, updating the UI, or synchronizing data.  

#### 9.2. How to Use `store.subscribe()`  
- **Step 1**: Declare a `count` variable to track how many times the store updates.  
- **Step 2**: Write a callback function to increment `count` every time an action occurs.  
- **Step 3**: Register this callback with `store.subscribe()`.  

#### 9.3. Exercise  
- Create a `count` variable and initialize it to 0.  
- Write a callback function that increases `count` whenever an action happens.  
- Use `store.subscribe(callback)` to track changes in the store.  
- Observe `count` change after calling `store.dispatch()` three times.

```javascript
const ADD = 'ADD';

const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

let count = 0; // Global variable to track store updates

// Callback function to increment count on each action
function listener() {
  count += 1;
  console.log(`Store updated! Count: ${count}`);
}

// Register the listener to the Redux store
store.subscribe(listener);

store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
```

#### 9.4. Notes  
- `store.subscribe()` does not update the state; it just tracks changes in the store.  
- The listener function does not receive parameters, but you can use `store.getState()` to access the current state if needed.  
- The listener runs automatically every time `dispatch()` is called.  
- Useful for logging, updating the UI, or syncing with `localStorage`/API.  

### 10. Combine Multiple Reducers  
#### 10.1. Why Combine Multiple Reducers  
- As the application grows, managing all the state in a single reducer becomes complex.  
- Redux requires all state to be in a single object, but you can split reducers to manage separate parts of the state.  
- Solution: Combine multiple reducers into one root reducer using `combineReducers()`.  

#### 10.2. What is `combineReducers()`?  
- `Redux.combineReducers()` combines multiple reducers into a single root reducer.  
- Each reducer manages a separate part of the state.  
- Redux creates an object containing the state, using the keys corresponding to each reducer.  

#### 10.3. How to Use `combineReducers()`  
Example with a notes app that has authentication:

```javascript
const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({
  auth: authenticationReducer, // Manages the auth state
  notes: notesReducer          // Manages the notes state
});
```
- `auth` will contain the state managed by `authenticationReducer`.  
- `notes` will contain the state managed by `notesReducer`.  
- Redux will store the state as `{ auth: ..., notes: ... }`.  

#### 10.4. Exercise  
```javascript
const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return state + 1;
    case DECREMENT:
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';
const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';

const authReducer = (state = { authenticated: false }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case LOGIN:
      return { authenticated: true };
    case LOGOUT:
      return { authenticated: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Combine reducers into rootReducer
const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({
  count: counterReducer, // State for counting
  auth: authReducer      // State for authentication
});

// Create Redux store with rootReducer
const store = Redux.createStore(rootReducer);
```

#### 10.5. Important Notes  
- Reducers are not altered, they are simply assigned into a root reducer object.  
- Redux store will have state in the form `{ count: ..., auth: ... }`.  
- Access data via `store.getState().count` or `store.getState().auth`.  
- You can extend the root reducer by adding more reducers inside `combineReducers()`. 

### 11. Send Action Data to the Store  
#### 11.1. Sending Data with Actions in Redux  
- Until now, we have learned how to dispatch actions to the store, but these actions did not carry specific data.  
- Typically, when a user performs an action (like clicking a button or entering data), the action will include related data (e.g., note content).  
- We need to send this data along with the action so that the Redux store can use it when updating the state.  

#### 11.2. How to Send Data with Actions  
- Every action has a `type` (describes the action type), and can also contain additional data.  
- For example, when adding a note, you might want to send the note's content with the action:

```javascript
function addNoteText(text) {
  return {
    type: "ADD_NOTE",
    text: text  // The data will be the note's content
  };
}
```

#### 11.3. Handling Action with Data in the Reducer  
- In the reducer, you need to check the action type and return a new state based on the data in the action.  
- For example, when receiving the action "ADD_NOTE", you extract the `text` value from the action and return a new state:

```javascript
function notesReducer(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_NOTE":
      return [...state, action.text];  // Add the new note to the state
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

#### 11.4. Exercise  
- Complete the `addNoteText()` function to return an action containing type `ADD_NOTE` and the `text` data.  
- Complete the switch statement in `notesReducer()` to handle the `ADD_NOTE` action and return a new state.  
- Test the result by dispatching `addNoteText()` to add a note to the store.

```javascript
const ADD_NOTE = 'ADD_NOTE';

const notesReducer = (state = 'Initial State', action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case ADD_NOTE:      
      return action.text;   // Update state with the note content
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const addNoteText = (note) => {
  return {
    type: ADD_NOTE,   // Action type
    text: note        // Note content data
  };
};

const store = Redux.createStore(notesReducer);

console.log(store.getState());
store.dispatch(addNoteText('Hello!'));
console.log(store.getState());
```

#### 11.5. Notes  
- Data in the action (like `text`) is the information sent to the store and used in the reducer to update the state.  
- Reducers always receive an action and return a new state without modifying the old state directly.  
- Combining actions with data makes it easy to track and change the state in your application.

### 12. Using Middleware to Handle Asynchronous Actions  
#### 12.1. Redux Thunk Middleware  
- Redux Thunk is a special middleware in Redux that allows you to handle asynchronous actions.  
- This middleware lets you return a function instead of an object in the action creator. This function receives `dispatch` as an argument and lets you dispatch actions asynchronously.  

#### 12.2. Configuring Redux Thunk Middleware  
- To use Redux Thunk, you need to add this middleware when creating the store:  
```javascript
const store = Redux.createStore(
  reducer, // root reducer
  Redux.applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk)  // Add Redux Thunk middleware
);
```

#### 12.3. Handling Asynchronous Actions  
- In the action creator, instead of returning a typical action object, you return a function that receives `dispatch` as an argument. This function performs asynchronous actions (like calling an API).  
- You can dispatch actions at different stages of the asynchronous request, for example:  
  - Dispatch before the request starts (e.g., show a loading indicator).  
  - Dispatch after the request completes with the received data.  

#### 12.4. Exercise for Asynchronous Action with Redux Thunk  
- **Action Creator `handleAsync()`**:  
  - Dispatch `requestingData()` before starting the request.  
  - Use `setTimeout()` to simulate an asynchronous API request.  
  - After receiving data, dispatch `receivedData()` with the data.

```javascript
const REQUESTING_DATA = 'REQUESTING_DATA';
const RECEIVED_DATA = 'RECEIVED_DATA';

const requestingData = () => { return { type: REQUESTING_DATA } };
const receivedData = (data) => { return { type: RECEIVED_DATA, users: data.users } };

const handleAsync = () => {
  return function(dispatch) {
    dispatch(requestingData());

    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = "Simulated data";  // Simulated API response

      dispatch(receivedData(data));
    }, 2500);
  }
};

const defaultState = {
  fetching: false,
  users: []
};

const asyncDataReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case REQUESTING_DATA:
      return {
        fetching: true,
        users: []
      }
    case RECEIVED_DATA:
      return {
        fetching: false,
        users: action.users
      }
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(
  asyncDataReducer,
  Redux.applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk.default)
);
```

#### 12.5. Notes  
- `requestingData()` is an action notifying that data is being requested, useful for displaying a loading indicator.  
- `receivedData()` is an action triggered when the data is received from the API.  
- Redux Thunk middleware helps you handle asynchronous actions smoothly in Redux. 

### Summary  
- Use Redux Thunk to manage asynchronous actions in Redux.  
- Middleware lets you return functions instead of objects in action creators.  
- Actions are dispatched in stages of the API request, from requesting data to receiving data.
