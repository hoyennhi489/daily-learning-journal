### REDUX  
#### 1. Create a Redux Store  
##### 1.1. Introduction to Redux Store  
- Redux is a state management framework that can be used with various web technologies (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).  
- Redux helps manage state centrally, preventing state from being scattered across multiple components.  

##### 1.2. Important Principles of Redux  
- **Single Source of Truth**:  
  - Redux uses a single state object to manage the entire application's state.  
  - Example: A React application with 10 components—rather than each component having its own state, Redux stores all the state in a single object called the Redux store.  
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**:  
  - The application state can only be updated through the Redux store.  
  - This makes it easier to track, control, and avoid errors caused by uncontrolled state changes.  

##### 1.3. How to Create a Redux Store  
- **What is a Redux store?**  
  - It is an object responsible for storing and managing the application’s state.  
- **Creating a Redux store using `createStore()`**  
  - Redux provides the `createStore()` method to create a Redux store.  
  - This method requires a reducer function as an argument.  

##### 1.4. What is a Reducer?  
- A reducer is a function that takes the current state and returns a new state.  
- In this lesson, the reducer has been predefined in the code editor.  
- A reducer must always return a new state and should not modify the previous state directly.  

##### 1.5. Implementation Steps  
- **Step 1**: Declare a `store` variable.  
- **Step 2**: Assign `store` using `createStore()` and pass the reducer as an argument.  
```js
const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
```
- **Note**:  
  - In this lesson, Redux uses ES6 default arguments to initialize the state with a default value of `5`.  
  - If you are not familiar with default arguments, refer to the ES6 section in the curriculum.  

### 2. Retrieve State from the Redux Store  
##### 2.1. Getting State from the Redux Store  
- Redux provides the `getState()` method to retrieve the current state of the store.  
- `getState()` returns the current state object managed by Redux.  

##### 2.2. How to Use `getState()`  
- Call `store.getState()` to retrieve the state from the Redux store.  
- Assign this value to a new variable, for example:  
```js
const currentState = store.getState();
```
- The `currentState` variable will now contain the current application state.  

##### 2.3. Exercise  
```js
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = 5) => state
);
const currentState = store.getState();
```

##### 2.4. Notes  
- `getState()` only returns the current state of the Redux store and does not modify it.  
- The Redux store cannot be directly modified—state can only be updated through actions and reducers.  

### 3. Define a Redux Action  
##### 3.1. Introduction to Redux Actions  
- Redux is a state management framework, and updating the state is one of its primary functions.  
- Actions in Redux are used to trigger state updates.  

##### 3.2. What is a Redux Action?  
- A Redux action is simply a JavaScript object containing information about an event that occurred in the application.  
- The Redux store receives the action and updates the state based on its content.  

##### 3.3. Structure of a Redux Action  
- An action must have a `type` property that defines the type of action occurring.  
- In addition to `type`, an action can contain additional data (payload).  
  - Example: When a user logs in, the action may include the username.  
- General structure of an action:  
```js
const action = {
  type: "ACTION_TYPE", 
  payload: { key: "value" } // (Optional)
};
```

##### 3.4. How Actions Work in Redux  
- Redux actions work like messengers:  
  - The application dispatches an action to notify that an event has occurred.  
  - The Redux store receives the action, processes it, and updates the state.  

##### 3.5. Exercise  
- Declare an action object with a `type` property set to `"LOGIN"`.  
```js
const action = {
  type: "LOGIN"
};
```

##### 3.6. Notes  
- Actions only describe events; they do not directly update the state.  
- The state is only updated through reducers when an action is received.  

### 4. Define an Action Creator  
##### 4.1. Introduction to Action Creators  
- After creating an action, we need to send it to the Redux store to update the state.  
- Action creators facilitate this by returning an action object.  

##### 4.2. What is an Action Creator?  
- An action creator is a simple JavaScript function that returns an action object when called.  
- Basic structure of an action creator:  
```js
function actionCreator() {
  return { type: "ACTION_TYPE" };
}
```
- Instead of writing actions directly, we use action creators to create actions more flexibly.  

##### 4.3. How to Use an Action Creator  
- When the application needs to change the state, it calls the action creator to get an action.  
- This action is then dispatched to the Redux store for processing.  

##### 4.4. Exercise  
- Declare a function `actionCreator()`, which returns an action object with `type: "LOGIN"`.  
```js
function actionCreator() {
  return { type: "LOGIN" };
}
```

##### 4.5. Notes  
- Action creators only create actions and do not change the state.  
- Actions must be dispatched to the store to trigger state updates.  

### 5. Dispatch an Action Event  
##### 5.1. Introduction to Dispatch in Redux  
- Redux uses the `dispatch()` method to send actions to the Redux store.  
- When calling `store.dispatch(action)`, the action is sent to the store to update the application state.  

##### 5.2. How to Dispatch an Action  
- **Method 1**: Call an action creator and dispatch the returned value:  
```js
store.dispatch(actionCreator());
```
- **Method 2**: Directly pass an action object into dispatch:  
```js
store.dispatch({ type: "LOGIN" });
```
- Both methods achieve the same result: sending an action with `type: "LOGIN"` to the Redux store.  

##### 5.3. How Dispatch Works  
1. The application calls `store.dispatch(action)`.  
2. The Redux store receives the action and passes it to the reducer.  
3. The reducer processes the action and updates the state.  
4. The application receives the updated state and reacts accordingly.  

##### 5.4. Exercise  
- The Redux store has been initialized with the initial state: `{ login: false }`.  
- An action creator `loginAction()` has been defined to return `{ type: "LOGIN" }`.  
- Task: Call `store.dispatch()` and pass in the action created from `loginAction()`.  
```js
store.dispatch(loginAction());
```

##### 5.5. Notes  
- Dispatch does not change the state immediately; it only sends the action to the store.  
- The reducer processes the action and updates the state accordingly.  
- UI components can react to state changes if connected to Redux.  

### 6. Handling an Action in the Store  
#### 6.1. Introduction to Reducer in Redux  
- A reducer is a function responsible for updating the application state based on the received action.  
- A reducer has no side effects, meaning it does not call APIs or modify the state directly.  
- The reducer always takes in the current state and an action, then returns a new state.  

#### 6.2. Important Principles of Reducer  
- A reducer must be a **pure function**:  
  - It does not modify the state directly.  
  - It does not call APIs or perform asynchronous operations.  
- **State in Redux is immutable (read-only)**:  
  - Always return a new copy of the state instead of modifying it directly.  

#### 6.3. Structure of a Reducer  
```javascript
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SOME_ACTION":
      return { ...state, key: newValue }; // Return new state
    default:
      return state; // Keep the current state if the action does not match
  }
}
```
- Use `switch-case` to check `action.type`.  
- Return a new copy of the state with updated values when necessary.  
- Always include a `default` case to return the current state if no matching action is found.  

#### 6.4. Exercise  
- The reducer takes in `state` and `action`.  
- If the action has `type: "LOGIN"`, update `state.login = true`.  
- Otherwise, return the current state.  

```javascript
const defaultState = {
  login: false
};

const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  // Change code below this line
  switch (action.type) {
    case "LOGIN":
      return { ...state, login: true }; // Return new state with login = true
    default:
      return state; // Keep the current state if the action does not match
  }
  // Change code above this line
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};
```

#### 6.5. Notes  
- Do **not** modify the state directly; always create a new copy (`{ ...state, login: true }`).  
- The reducer only processes the state; it does not contain external logic (such as API calls).  
- Using `switch-case` makes the code more readable and easier to extend in the future.
