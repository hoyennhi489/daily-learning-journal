**Step 13:**
```javascript
let profession = "teacher";
let age;
console.log(age);
console.log(profession);
```

**Step 14:** Remove the review code and keep the `character` variable unchanged.

**Step 15:**
```javascript
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
```
- Numeric Value: In JavaScript, numeric values are used directly without quotes, differentiating them from string values.

**Step 16:**
```javascript
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
console.log(count + 1);
```
- Arithmetic Operations on Numeric Data Types: By adding 1 to the `count` variable, you can perform a simple addition operation with the value of `count`.
- Printing Results to the Console: When you run this code, the console will display the result of `count + 1`, which is 9 (since `count` has an initial value of 8).

**Step 17:**
- Testing Arithmetic Operations:
```javascript
console.log(count - 2); 
console.log(count * 3); 
console.log(count / 4); 
```
- After testing, remove the `console.log()` statements.
- Clean Up After Testing: To keep your code clean and focused on the lesson's objectives, you should delete the `console.log()` lines after completing your tests.

**Step 18:**
```javascript
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
```
- Assigning an Empty Array to `rows`: Use square brackets `[]` to create an empty array.
```javascript
let rows = [];
```
- Array: An array is a non-primitive data type that can hold multiple values. Unlike primitive data types such as strings or numbers, which hold a single value, an array can store multiple elements.

**Step 19:**
```javascript
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
```
- Array with Multiple Elements: When declaring an array with elements, each element is enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.
- Order and Case Sensitivity: The order of elements in an array is significant because it stores elements in specific positions. JavaScript strings are case-sensitive, meaning "CamperChan" is different from "camperchan".

**Step 20:**
```javascript
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
console.log(rows[0]);
```
- Accessing Elements by Index: In an array, elements are indexed starting from 0. Therefore, `rows[0]` will access the first element, "Naomi".
- Printing an Element to the Console: When using `console.log(rows[0])`, the console will display "Naomi" as the first element in the array.

**Step 21:**
```javascript
rows[2] = 10;
console.log(rows);
```
- Arrays Can Change Element Values: For example, `rows[2] = 10;` will change the value of the third element to 10.

**Step 22:**
```javascript
rows[2] = 10;
rows[rows.length - 1] = 10;
```
- Mutation: Changing values in an array (like changing `rows[2]` to 10) is called mutation. Understanding when to directly modify an array will be helpful.
- Accessing the Last Element:
  - Formula: `array[array.length - 1]` allows you to get the last element without needing to know the exact number of elements.

**Step 23:**
- Remove the first `console.log()` statement and the assignment for `rows[rows.length - 1]`.

**Step 24:**
```javascript
let cities = ["London", "New York", "Mumbai"];
console.log(cities);
cities[cities.length - 1] = "Mexico City";
console.log(cities);
```

**Step 25:**
- Code Cleanup: Practicing the removal of unnecessary code helps keep your code concise and prepares it for future lessons.

**Step 26:**
```javascript
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
console.log(rows);
```
- The `.push()` Method: `.push()` is a method used to add a new element to the end of an array. This syntax is very convenient for updating an array without needing a specific index.

**Step 27:**
```javascript
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
let popped = rows.pop();
console.log(popped);
console.log(rows);
```
- The `.pop()` Method: `.pop()` not only removes the last element from the array but also returns its value, allowing you to use that value elsewhere in your code.
- Storing the Removed Value: Assigning the returned value from `.pop()` to a variable (like `popped`) helps you store and reuse the value of the removed element.

**Step 28:**
```javascript
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
let pushed = rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
console.log(pushed);
```
- Return Value of `.push()`: `.push()` returns the new number of elements in the array after adding the element.

**Step 29:** Remove all calls to `.push()` and `.pop()` as well as the `console.log()` statements.

**Step 30:**
```javascript
let character = "Hello";
let count = 8;
let rows = [];
```

**Step 31:**
```javascript
const character = "Hello";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
```
- Using `const`: Using `const` for variables that donâ€™t need to change helps protect their values and avoids unintended errors in the code.
- `const` Restrictions: A `const` variable must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be changed or reassigned.

**Step 32:**
```javascript
const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
```
- Changing the Value of `character`: The hash character `"#"` will be used to build the pyramid, making the pyramid clearer and easier to visualize.
