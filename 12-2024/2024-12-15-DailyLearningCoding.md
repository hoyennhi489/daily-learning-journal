### Step 61-62:
```javascript
window.addEventListener("keyup", ({ key }) => {
  movePlayer(key, 0, false);
});
```

1. **`window.addEventListener("keyup", ...)`:**  
   - Listens for the `keyup` event on the `window` object.  
   - The `keyup` event is triggered when a key is released after being pressed.  

2. **`({ key }) => { ... }`:**  
   - Uses destructuring syntax in the parameter to extract only the `key` property from the event object.  
   - `key` holds the value of the key that was released, e.g., `"ArrowUp"`, `"a"`, `"Enter"`, etc.  

3. **`movePlayer(key, 0, false)`:**  
   - Calls the `movePlayer` function with three arguments:  
     - `key`: The value of the released key, used to determine direction or action.  
     - `0`: A numeric value, possibly representing an axis or position (depending on the logic of `movePlayer`).  
     - `false`: A boolean value, which could represent a state or mode of operation (also depending on `movePlayer`).

### Step 63:
```javascript
const startGame = () => {
  canvas.style.display = "block";
  startScreen.style.display = "none";

  animate();
};
```

- **`animate`:** This function is used in game programming to continuously update frames, creating a motion effect.

---

### Step 64:
```javascript
class Platform {};
```

- The `Platform` class will store information about a specific platform, such as its position, size, and methods to render it on the screen.

---

### Step 65:
```javascript
class Platform {
  constructor(x, y) {}
}
```

1. **Constructor:**  
   - The constructor in a class is called when you create an object from the class.  
   - It helps initialize the initial values of the object's properties.  

2. **Coordinates `x` and `y`:**  
   - `x`: Determines the horizontal position of the platform on the screen.  
   - `y`: Determines the vertical position of the platform on the screen.  

---

### Step 66:
```javascript
class Platform {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.position = { x, y }; // Uses shorthand property name syntax
  }
}
```

- **Shorthand Property Name Syntax:**  
  - This syntax simplifies code when the property name and value are the same.  
  - Instead of writing `a: a`, you can simply write `a`, and JavaScript will infer that you want to assign the value of `a` to the property `a`.  

---

### Step 67-70:
```javascript
class Platform {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.position = {
      x,
      y,
    };
    this.width = 200; // Default width is 200 if no value is provided
    this.height = proportionalSize(40); // Height is proportional to the screen size
  }

  draw() {
    ctx.fillStyle = "#acd157"; // Sets the fill color for the platform
    ctx.fillRect(this.position.x, this.position.y, this.width, this.height); // Draws a rectangle (the platform)
  }
}
```

1. **`proportionalSize()`:**  
   - This function calculates size as a percentage of the screen dimensions, ensuring the game displays correctly on various screen sizes.  

2. **`ctx.fillStyle`:**  
   - The `fillStyle` property specifies the color or pattern used to fill shapes. Here, it assigns the color `"#acd157"` (a light green) to the platforms.  

3. **`ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height)`:**  
   - The `fillRect` method draws a filled rectangle with the following parameters:  
     - `x`: Horizontal position of the rectangle.  
     - `y`: Vertical position of the rectangle.  
     - `width`: Width of the rectangle.  
     - `height`: Height of the rectangle.  

---

### Step 71:
```javascript
const platformPositions = [];
```

- `platformPositions` is an empty array where you will store objects containing information about the platforms, such as their positions and sizes.  

---

### Step 72-74:
```javascript
const platformPositions = [
  { x: 500, y: proportionalSize(450) },
  { x: 700, y: proportionalSize(400) },
  { x: 850, y: proportionalSize(350) },
  { x: 900, y: proportionalSize(350) },
  { x: 1050, y: proportionalSize(150) },
  { x: 2500, y: proportionalSize(450) },
  { x: 2900, y: proportionalSize(400) },
  { x: 3150, y: proportionalSize(350) },
  { x: 3900, y: proportionalSize(450) },
  { x: 4200, y: proportionalSize(400) },
  { x: 4400, y: proportionalSize(200) },
  { x: 4700, y: proportionalSize(150) },
];
```

1. **`x: 500`:** Specifies the horizontal position of the platform as `500`.  
2. **`y: proportionalSize(450)`:** The function `proportionalSize(450)` returns a value proportional to the screen height. This value determines the vertical position of the platform.  

---

### Step 75-76:
```javascript
const platforms = platformPositions.map(
  (platform) => new Platform(platform.x, platform.y)
);
```

1. **`platformPositions.map(...)`:**  
   - `map()` is a JavaScript method that creates a new array by applying a function to each element in the original array.  
   - In this case, `platformPositions` is transformed into a new array containing `Platform` objects.  

2. **`(platform) => new Platform(platform.x, platform.y)`:**  
   - This is an arrow function passed to `map()`. It takes each object `platform` from the `platformPositions` array.  
   - The `x` and `y` values are used to create a new `Platform` object with `new Platform(platform.x, platform.y)`.  

---

### Step 77:
```javascript
platforms.forEach((platform) => {
  platform.draw();
});
```

1. **`platforms.forEach(...)`:**  
   - `forEach()` is a method to iterate over all elements in an array. For each element, a callback function is executed.  
   - Here, `platforms` is an array of `Platform` objects, and `forEach()` calls the callback function for each `Platform`.  

2. **`(platform) => { platform.draw(); }`:**  
   - This arrow function calls the `draw()` method for each `Platform` object, rendering them on the screen.  

3. **`platform.draw();`:**  
   - The `draw()` method from the `Platform` class uses `ctx.fillRect()` (or similar methods) to render the platform based on properties like `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`.
