Today I learned about:

- **Markdown** is a text markup language used to add text formatting such as headings, bold text, italics, etc.

- **Git** is a tool that helps manage source code effectively, supports teamwork and remembers the entire history of changes during use such as editing, adding - deleting lines of code, all of which are recorded and stored by Git.

- **GitHub** is an online source code storage platform, providing services for storing and managing Git repositories on the internet.
    Git is a tool for managing source code versions, while GitHub is a web service that helps store and collaborate on projects using Git.

- **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) is a free tool for writing and editing source code. It helps programmers work with code more easily thanks to features such as error checking and Git support.
