1. Clearly distinguish between UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface)
2. Understand the roles of UX and UI in the product design lifecycle
3. Identify UX/UI roles in both small and large companies

---

## 3. What Is UX? (User Experience)

### 3.1 Definition of UX

UX is not just the interface of a website or an application. UX is the entire experience a customer has with a business, including:

* Staff
* Service
* Food
* Space and decoration
* Menu
* Restrooms
* Website and applications

In this course, UX focuses on the process of designing and redesigning the Little Lemon website.

### 3.2 What UX Focuses On

UX is the process of asking questions and finding answers, such as:

* What are customers’ real needs?
* What prevents users from ordering food or making reservations?
* Is the website easy to use?
* Can users place orders quickly?
* Is the transition between steps (choosing dishes, customizing, checkout) smooth?

UX ensures that a product is:

* Easy to understand
* Easy to use
* Efficient in helping users achieve their goals

# UX Goals and Usability

## 1. Identifying the Right Problem

After discussions with Adrian, it becomes clear that:

* Customers cannot easily make reservations or place orders
* This is a **usability** issue

→ It is not just about visual appearance.

UX/UI must:

* Understand customer frustration
* Align user goals with business goals

---

## 2. What Is Usability?

Usability measures whether a product is:

* Easy to learn
* Easy to use
* Error-resistant
* Satisfying

A product with good usability:

* Reduces confusion
* Lowers abandonment rates
* Increases task completion rates (reservations, orders)

---

## 3. Jakob Nielsen’s 5 Usability Components

### 3.1 Learnability

* Is it easy to understand on first use?
* Is the ordering/reservation flow clear?

Example:

* Can a first-time user successfully place an order?

### 3.2 Efficiency

* Once learned, is the process fast?
* Is editing an order easy?

Example:

* Changing a dish in just a few steps
* No need to restart the process

### 3.3 Memorability

* Can users resume easily after a break?
* Do they remember where they left off?

Example:

* Returning to the reservation page and remembering the selected date

### 3.4 Errors

* Are errors easy to make?
* When errors occur:

  * Are warnings clear?
  * Are recovery options available?

Example:

* Entering an invalid email → specific error message
* Preventing errors before form submission

### 3.5 Satisfaction

* Is the experience pleasant?
* Does it feel comfortable and enjoyable?

Note:

* Satisfaction is hard to measure
* But it is easy to recognize when a product “feels good” to use

---

## 4. Applying Usability Early to Avoid Problems

When usability is considered early:

* Problems are detected sooner
* Fixing costs are reduced
* Wrong design directions are avoided

Good UX:

* Solves problems before they become serious

---

## 5. UX Goals

### 5.1 Desired Experience

Design should feel:

* Pleasant
* Comfortable
* Satisfying
* Efficient
* Intuitive
* Effortless

Users should feel:

* Supported
* In control
* Empowered

### 5.2 Experiences to Avoid

Design should not be:

* Slow
* Confusing
* Complex
* Stressful
* Frustrating
* Causing users to give up

---

## 6. Supportive but Non-Intrusive Design

A good design should be:

* Helpful
* Clear
* Non-annoying
* Not patronizing

Examples in Little Lemon:

* Showing available tables
* Indicating how long a table is held
* Clearly displaying reservation details

---

## 7. Considering Accessibility

Design should consider:

* Users with mobility limitations
* Special needs (near entrances, wide walkways)

If direct support is not possible:

* Information must be easy to find
* A way to note special requests should be provided

---

## 8. UX Happens Before Visual Design

Even without drawing interfaces:

* User goals have been analyzed
* Potential problems have been anticipated
* Solution directions have been defined

This is proper UX thinking.

---

## 9. Summary

* Little Lemon’s problem is usability
* UX must balance user goals and business goals
* Nielsen’s 5 usability components:

  1. Learnability
  2. Efficiency
  3. Memorability
  4. Errors
  5. Satisfaction
* Usability and UX goals should be considered early
* This leads to smarter and more enjoyable products

---

## What Is UI? The Role of UI in UX/UI Design

### 1. What Is UI?

UI (User Interface) is what people see and directly interact with when using a digital product such as a website or application.

UI includes:

* Information layout
* Colors
* Typography
* Icons
* Images
* Buttons, forms, menus
* Feedback on click, tap, and hover

In short:
**UI is how humans communicate with technology.**

---

### 2. What Does “Interface” Mean?

An interface refers to interaction or communication.

Humans interact with:

* Other humans (email, messages)
* Machines and technology (phones, printers, websites)

Examples:

* Adjusting printer settings
* Ordering a drink and tracking the preparation process
* Ordering food on the Little Lemon website

All of these are forms of interaction through an interface.

---

### 3. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

GUI is the most common type of interface today, using:

* Images
* Icons
* Text
* Colors
* Visual space

On the Little Lemon website, GUI includes:

* Menu page
* Reservation page
* Ordering page
* “Order,” “Reserve,” and “Checkout” buttons

---

### 4. UI Is Not Just What You See

UI is not only static visuals.
It also includes:

* What happens when a button is clicked
* Feedback after user actions
* Loading, error, and success states
* How the system responds to users

Examples:

* Clicking “Reserve a Table” → confirmation message
* No tables available → clear and understandable notification

---

### 5. UI Is Task-Oriented

**Real-Life Examples**

* Car dashboard:

  * Press the accelerator → speed indicator increases
  * Warning lights → feedback for the driver
* Mobile phone:

  * Battery and Wi-Fi indicators → system status communication

UI helps people:

* Understand what is happening
* Know what action to take next

---

### 6. Importance of UI

Well-designed UI can:

* Enable fast and accurate interaction
* Reduce errors
* Increase trust
* Even save lives

Examples:

* Medical devices displaying vital signs
* Aircraft cockpits in poor weather conditions

For Little Lemon:

* Poor UI → users abandon orders
* Good UI → increased orders and reservations

---

### 7. Brief History of UI

**Xerox PARC**

* First computers with graphical user interfaces
* Introduced:

  * Desktop
  * Windows
  * Menus
  * Icons

These design metaphors:

* Help users relate to the real world
* Make systems easier to learn and use

**Smartphones & Tablets**

* Multi-touch screens

## Types of Digital Design

### 1. Overview

As design evolves, terminology expands. To learn UX/UI effectively, it is important to understand where UX and UI sit within the **design spectrum** and how they relate to other design types.

There are four main groups:

1. Service Design
2. Customer Experience Design (CX)
3. User Experience Design (UX)
4. User Interface Design (UI)

---

### 2. Service Design

**Definition**
Service Design covers the entire service experience, including:

* Digital components
* Non-digital elements (offline experiences, people, processes)

It considers every touchpoint between a business and its customers.

**Little Lemon Example**
Service Design includes:

* Reservation website
* Service staff
* Customer greeting process
* Restaurant space
* Complaint handling

👉 This is the broadest level.

---

### 3. Customer Experience Design (CX)

**Definition**
CX focuses on:

* The overall experience with a brand
* All interactions before, during, and after using a service

**Difference from Service Design**

* Service Design: designs the entire service system
* CX: focuses on customer perception and journey with the brand

**Little Lemon Example**
CX includes:

* Brand impression
* Emotions during reservation
* Feelings after dining
* Likelihood of returning or recommending

---

### 4. User Experience Design (UX)

**Definition**
UX focuses on:

* All interactions between users and a specific touchpoint
* The overall feeling during use

⚠️ UX is not visual design.

UX considers:

* Ease of use
* Frustration levels
* Goal achievement
* Emotional response

**Examples**
If users:

* Cannot easily make reservations
* Do not know which dishes are available
  → These are UX problems.

---

### 5. User Interface Design (UI)

**Definition**
UI focuses on:

* Pixel-perfect digital interfaces
* Colors
* Typography
* Icons
* Buttons
* Layout
* Interaction states

UI answers:

* What does the solution look like and how is it interacted with?

**UX–UI Relationship**

* UX defines problems and experiences
* UI visualizes UX solutions

👉 UI must serve UX and cannot exist independently.

---

### 6. User-Centered Design (UCD)

**Definition**
UCD is an iterative process where:

* User needs
* Desires
* Limitations

are considered at every design stage.

**Core Principle**
Users are at the center of all design decisions.

**Benefits**

* Clear understanding of real user needs
* Avoids subjective design decisions
* Reduces the risk of product failure

---

### 7. Design Thinking

**Definition**
Design Thinking is a creative problem-solving approach based on:

* A structured process
* Encouragement of creativity

Although it seems contradictory, constraints and structure actually enhance creativity.

---

### 8. The 5 Steps of Design Thinking

1. **Empathize**

   * Understand users
   * Observe and interview
   * Listen to frustrations

   Example:
   “Ordering this takes too much time.”

2. **Define**

   * Synthesize data
   * Identify core problems

   Example:
   Users need to quickly understand the menu to decide what to order.

3. **Ideate**

   * Brainstorm
   * Sketch
   * Avoid limiting early ideas

4. **Prototype**

   * Wireframes
   * Sketches
   * Low- or high-fidelity prototypes

5. **Test**

   * Test with real users
   * Observe behavior
   * Identify issues
   * Iterate and improve

→ This is an **iterative**, not linear, process.

---

### 9. Summary

* Service Design: entire service system
* CX: brand experience
* UX: experience at a specific touchpoint
* UI: visual and interactive interface
* UCD: user-centered approach
* Design Thinking: creative problem-solving framework
* 5 steps: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test

👉 **Use when:** evaluating interaction flows, multi-step processes, complex systems.

---

## 4. How to Use This Checklist Effectively

* No need to apply 100% of the principles
* When evaluating:

  1. Choose **one main framework**
  2. Focus on the **most critical flow** (e.g., an order form)
  3. Prioritize fixing issues with the **largest impact on experience**

---

# DESIGNING FOR ACCESSIBILITY

## 1. What Is Accessibility?

Accessibility enables people with disabilities to:

* Perceive
* Understand
* Navigate
* Interact
* Contribute to the web

Includes people who are:

* Blind, color-blind, or have low vision
* Deaf or hard of hearing
* Have limited mobility (temporary or permanent)
* Have cognitive difficulties

👉 Good design is not only for “people like us,” but for as many people as possible.

---

## 2. Correct Understanding of Accessibility Design

* Accessibility does **not** make products ugly or boring
* Accessibility creates **positive design constraints**
* Constraints help to:

  * Reduce errors
  * Improve usability
  * Benefit all users

👉 Accessible design = smarter design

---

## 3. Do Not Use Color Alone to Convey Information

**Incorrect:**

* Using red only to indicate errors
* Using green only to distinguish states

**Correct:**

* Combine color + icon + text
* Examples:

  * Required field: asterisk (*) + label + color
  * Charts: color + symbols + labels

**Why:**

* 1 in 12 men is color-blind
* Many people have low vision or are completely blind

---

## 4. Ensure Sufficient Contrast

* Text against background: minimum **4.5 : 1**
* Large text:

  * ≥ 24px normal
  * ≥ 19px bold
    → can be reduced to **3 : 1**

Applies to:

* Text
* Buttons
* Icons
* Text on images / gradients

Does not apply to:

* Logos
* Text embedded in decorative images

---

## 5. Interactive Elements Must Be Clearly Identifiable

Interactive elements include:

* Buttons
* Links
* Menus
* Clickable icons

Requirements:

* Clearly look clickable
* Clear states:

  * Hover
  * Focus (keyboard)
  * Active

Especially important for people who:

* Do not use a mouse
* Rely only on the keyboard

👉 Always provide a clear keyboard focus (outline, highlight)

---

## 6. Clear Form Labels

* Every input field needs a descriptive label
* Label placement:

  * To the left
  * Or above the input field
* Avoid placing labels too far from inputs

Exceptions:

* Checkboxes
* Radio buttons (labels usually on the right)

👉 Do not rely on placeholders alone

---

## 7. Clear and Consistent Navigation

* Consistent naming
* Consistent navigation placement
* Provide multiple navigation methods:

  * Menu
  * Search
  * Sitemap
  * Breadcrumbs

Goal:

* Users always know:

  * Where they are
  * Where they can go next

---

## 8. Provide Clear Feedback

Feedback is needed when:

* A form is successfully submitted
* An error occurs
* An important action is completed

Good feedback:

* Highly visible
* Clear language
* Actionable guidance (not just error messages)

Examples:

* Error lists
* Icons + background color
* Messages placed near the error location

---

## 9. Use Headings and White Space to Group Content

* Headings help:

  * Fast scanning
  * Understanding content structure
* White space helps:

  * Show relationships
  * Reduce cognitive load

👉 Especially important for:

* People with attention difficulties
* Screen reader users

---

## 10. Design for Multiple Screen Sizes

Must be tested on:

* Mobile
* Desktop
* High zoom levels (for low vision)

Pay attention to:

* Font size
* Line length
* Position of headings and navigation

👉 Not only responsive, but readable

---

## 11. Auto-Playing Content Must Have Controls

Applies to:

* Carousels
* Videos
* Audio
* Auto-running animations

Requirements:

* Pause button
* Clear controls
* No sudden or distracting behavior

---

## 12. Conclusion

* Designing for accessibility = responsible design
* The better users are understood → the better the experience
* Accessibility is not only for people with disabilities, but for everyone

---

# Form Design and Best Practices in UX/UI

## 1. The Role of Design Principles in UX/UI

Good design principles are often combined with best practices when creating digital products.
Even very simple components such as forms can cause frustration if they are not designed with user experience in mind.

In this lesson, login and food-ordering forms from the Little Lemon website are used as examples to illustrate the importance of proper form design.

---

## 2. Why Form Design Matters

Forms are the direct point of interaction between users and the system.
If a form is poorly designed, users may:

* Misunderstand the questions
* Enter incorrect information
* Abandon the process halfway

Analyzing forms based on:

* Usability
* User goals

helps create logical, user-centered solutions that feel familiar to most people.

---

## 3. Design Thinking Based on Best Practices

Every interface element—simple or complex—follows the same foundational rules:

* Clarity
* Ease of understanding
* Consistency

Regularly reviewing and applying best practices helps build correct design thinking from the beginning.
The course also provides additional materials and detailed guidance on form design best practices.

---

## 4. Using User Feedback to Improve Forms

After collecting feedback through interviews and observation, the form was redesigned in HTML for testing.
An experienced UX/UI designer (Enzo) was invited to review the prototype and provide feedback.

---

## 5. Identified Issues and Improvements

### 5.1. Unclear Questions and Input Fields

Issues:

* Some questions were difficult to understand
* Input fields were placed too close together

Solutions:

* Increase spacing between fields such as text inputs, password fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons
* Help users clearly distinguish each field and its corresponding label

---

### 5.2. Lack of Logical Information Grouping

Issue:

* Information sections were mixed together, causing confusion

Solutions:

* Group information logically (e.g., address, payment)
* Use subtle background colors or dividers to separate groups

---

### 5.3. No Awareness of Progress in the Process

Issues:

* No visible progress
* Unclear how many steps remained
* No way to return to previous steps

Solutions:

* Add a progress indicator
* Allow users to go back and review or edit entered information

---

### 5.4. Late and Unclear Error Messages

Issues:

* Errors appeared only after the entire form was completed
* Errors did not clearly indicate what was wrong or where

Solutions:

* Validate input as users type (inline validation)
* Display clear, contextual error messages for each section

---

### 5.5. Password Requirements Not Explained

Issues:

* The system required complex passwords
* Criteria were not clearly stated

Solutions:

* Clearly display password requirements
* Add a password strength indicator
* Provide immediate feedback while typing

---

## 6. The Value of Feedback in UX/UI Design

Collecting feedback from others helps to:

* Identify issues early
* Improve accessibility
* Make forms easier to understand and use

---

## 7. Conclusion

In this lesson, the following were achieved:

* Understanding the importance of clear form design
* Applying best practices to improve usability
* Using clear layouts, proper field spacing, and logical information grouping
* Aligning business goals with user goals

The result is a product that is closer to a successful UX/UI design.

# Component-Driven Design and Design Systems

## 1. What Is Component-Driven Design?

In modern product design, many teams use component-driven design to build interfaces more efficiently and consistently.
This approach improves components on the Little Lemon website and helps create attractive, user-friendly interfaces.

---

## 2. Components in UI Design

In UI design, a component is:

* A part of the interface
* Logically grouped
* Able to function independently
* Reusable

Components can be small (buttons) or large (headers, forms).

---

## 3. How to Build Components

The component-building process usually includes three steps:

1. **Start with small components**

   * Examples: buttons, search fields, menu items

2. **Combine small components into complex components**

   * Example: a header containing a logo, navigation bar, and reservation button

3. **Use components to create complete interfaces**

   * Entire pages are assembled from components

---

## 4. Real-World Example: Website Header

Headers appear on many pages of a website.
Instead of redesigning the header for each page:

* Create a shared header component
* The header contains child components such as:

  * Buttons
  * Search bars
  * Navigation bars

These child components remain independent and reusable elsewhere.

---

## 5. Benefits of Component-Driven Design

Designing interfaces using modular building blocks provides many benefits:

* Faster design and development
* Easier creation of variations for different actions
* Consistent interfaces
* Easier for users to learn and remember
* Better overall visual experience

---

## 6. What Is a Design System?

A design system is:

* A collection of pre-designed components and patterns
* Used to build products at scale
* Similar to a brand style guide

A design system includes:

* Rules
* Behaviors
* Best practices for design components

---

## 7. Common Parts of a Design System

There is no fixed checklist, but successful design systems usually include:

### 7.1. Design Guidelines

* Reflect brand values and identity
* Define color, typography, spacing, and tone of voice

---

### 7.2. Design Pattern Library

* A collection of widely accepted and reused design patterns
* According to the Interaction Design Foundation:
  A pattern is a repetition of multiple design elements working together
* Elements may include shapes, lines, and colors

---

### 7.3. UI Kit / Component Library

* A collection of UI components
* Examples: buttons, inputs, widgets, modals
* Enables fast and consistent interface creation

---

### 7.4. Process Design Guidelines

* Guidance on the design process
* Helps apply design principles correctly during work
* Supports consistent design decision-making

---
