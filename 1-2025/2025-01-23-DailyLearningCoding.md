**Day 12**  
Today, I continued working on my personal project but still couldn't finish it.  

I encountered some issues related to the shopping cart. Specifically, I wrote JavaScript code to add items and display the quantity in the cart. However, I ran into problems when trying to open and display the cart's contents, and I haven't resolved them yet.  

I will keep improving and fixing the issue tomorrow. Writing these lines is my way of recording my progress for today.
